###Research Question  
Drawing a comparison between France and Britain, to what extent do the behavioural characteristics of the education system - the degree of reliance on positive reinforcement in teaching - affect the rate of entrepreneurship in each country?

###Research Justification
When it comes to public budgeting for education policies, the decision process often does not appear to be rational. That is, it does not seem to take into account the return on investment that should be expected in the long run. Despite this, many claims have been made in the entrepreneurship literature that start-up activities at a country-level are affected by factors other than structural and economic, including cultural and educational. However only a few empirical studies have actually been carried out and most of them focused on which attitudes were favourable to starting a business, while almost none explored how cultural patterns affected these dispositions.  

When cultural factors are examined, they are considered as a given feature that can hardly be traced. By having a closer look at education systems, we intend to explore the processes through which some of these cultural patterns are enhanced and passed from one generation to the next. Aside from parental education, schools are indeed the very place where children are taught how to fit into society. This research is an attempt at looking at one trait in particular, self-confidence.

###Analytical Method
####Causal Chain

Stronger culture of positive reinforcement ---> higher degree of individual self-esteem ---> higher probability an individual will become an entrepreneur ---> higher rate of entrepreneurship at a country-level



####Estimation Strategy  
The estimation strategy will consist of using cross-sectional data about France and Britain at different points in time regarding the sense of belonging to a group, self-confidence patterns and the entrepreneurship features of each country.

The dependent variable will be the rate of entrepreneurship with its related activities or attitudes as defined by the [Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)](http://www.gemconsortium.org):

- Established Business Ownership Rate;   
- Entrepreneurial intention; and  
- Entrepreneurship as desirable career choice.  

The key explanatory variable will be the degree of self confidence as an index that we will compute from both OECD PISA, World Value Survey (Data from 2012 and 2005/2006 respectively) and GEM (Fear of failure rate, perceived capabilities).  

As mentioned above, we will need to control for the economic outlook at the time of data collection about entrepreneurship characteristics. We will also need to control for nine key entrepreneurship conditions as defined in the [National Experts Survey (NES)](http://www.gemiran.ir/sec/gem/?@=28) that may affect the rate of entrepreneurship. These nine conditions are the following:  


1. Finance  
2. Government policies  
3. Government programmes  
4. Entrepreneurial Education and Training  
5. Research and Development Transfer (R & D)  
6. Commercial and professional infrastructure  
7. Internal Market openness  
8. Physical infrastructure and services  
9. Cultural and social norms


The first step will be to see if, regarding self-confidence, different patterns can be observed in each country. In which case, we may need to call on cultural explanations.

Then, should indeed different patterns be observed, we will need to proceed to an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) Regression in order to check to what extent these characteristics affect the rate of entrepreneurship in the country.  

Our main hypothesis is that the more self-confident a population is on average, the higher entrepreneurship in that country will be.  
 

###Necessary Concepts  
1. Return on Investment: Assigning a future Euro value to a present-day investment. This may require the use of a social discount rate, but will also need to consider the potential GDP increase brought about by improved education policies.  

2. Self-confidence: It is difficult to obtain a credible measurement of self confidence, but we will compute an index  to include some quantiative approach to measuring this factor.

3. Positive reinforcement: This can possibly be computed as an index and characterized on a scale even if this is not easy to quantify.

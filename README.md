#### Project Introduction
This is a branch of the Assignment2Education repository linked to our [project website](http://samdund.github.io/Assign2Education/).

The website divides our project into the following sections:

1. Research Question  
2. Project Overview
3. Variables
4. Causal Chain  
5. Geographic Variation in our Explanatory Variable
6. Statistical Analysis
7. Conclusions  

The core of our output for this project is accessable in the interactive chart at the top of the page.  With this chart, users can choose variables for the x and y axis and see the variation among OECD countries and over time.  This chart was created using googleVis.  Citations for this and other packages used in the creation of the website can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamDund/Assign2Education/gh-pages/RpackageCitations.bib).  


#### Sources  
Data used to create the website is imported from the main or gh-pages branch using the repmis program (as indicated in the [index.Rmd](https://github.com/SamDund/Assign2Education/blob/gh-pages/index.Rmd) file).  


#### Other Relevant Repository Branch Files

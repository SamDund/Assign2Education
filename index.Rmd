**Key Question**
To what extent do teaching methods supporting self-confidence affect the rate of entrepreneurship in OECD countries?

We have drawn on publicly availabile data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) National Entrepreneurship Survey (NES) and Adult Population Survey (APS) to create graphic visualizations of participants' responses to surveys about entrepreneurship. 

The following interactive chart can be utilized to see the relationship between the variables we investigated. Among other features, the independent and dependent variables can be selected to see the relationship between each of the variables.

```{r echo =FALSE, cache=FALSE, include=TRUE, results='asis', warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggvis)
library(devtools)
library(googleVis)
library(countrycode)
library(repmis)
library(reshape2)
library(RJSONIO)
library(shiny)
library(httpuv)


CD <- repmis::source_data("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamDund/Assign2Education/master/GEMData/CompleteData.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = "NA")

# Set Year column as a date
CD$Year <- as.Date(as.character(CD$Year), format = "%Y")

# Dropp X column
CD$X <- NULL

R <- gvisMotionChart(CD, idvar = "Country", timevar = "Year")

print(R, tag = 'chart')
```

As indicated in the chart, our analysis investigated the variation among OECD countries in each of the following variables.
